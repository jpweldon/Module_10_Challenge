# Cryptocurrency Portfolio Proposal

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is the scenario that I am an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so I want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing my proposal on only returns and volatility, I want to include other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for my portfolio.

When I present the idea, my manager loves it. So, I am asked to create a prototype for submitting my crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

I have created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. The Jupyter notebook contains statistics, analysis, and plots.
